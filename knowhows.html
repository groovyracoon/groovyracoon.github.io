						<h2>Equipment</h2>
						<p class="paragraphs">One of the cool things about 
						hiking is that you don’t need a bunch of high-tech gear
						to get out there. With a few essential items for the trail 
						and a sense of adventure, you’re ready to head into the wilderness.
						Essentials would be navigation items (map and a compass), provisions
						(water,dry food),illumination, first aid kit. Shoes also should be 
						chosen accordingly - hiking shoes should fix one's ankle securely.
						Going to high altitudes like glaciers would require more gear - proper, 
						warm clothes and snow shoes</p>

						<h2>Precautions</h2>
						<p class="paragraphs">Mountains could be dangerous place for unprepaired
						hikers. Mountains around Skagway are as challenging as it could get. Going
						by yourself is tremendous experience, yet newbies should consider going with
						somebody. Bear spray is something that one should grab - there many of them 
						in the area. Visiting the ranger center prior to your hike is also a must - 
						friendly rangers will gladly give you tips about specific trail.</p>
