						<h2>AB Mountain</h2>
						<p class="paragraphs">The AB mountain used to be one of my favourites, though I hiked it only 
						two times. I could've only wish to do it more, but it took me seven hours to ascend. Half of the
						journey takes you through a dense forest, completely walkable. The other half was mostly bush-wacking
						and climbing rocky, vertical slopes. It got more and more dangerous by the top, since I had to grab roots
						which made some rocks to slide, but nothing to critical. Making it to the very top rewarded me with a 
						beautiful view of the ocean channel and valley</p>

						<h2>The Upper Lake</h2>
						<p class="paragraphs">The Upper Lake trail is moderate enough to spend half of the day for. Most of it is
						ascention on the 45-degree trail, sometimes climbing huge boulders. There are many waterfalls on the way where
						you could stop by to rest, but I personally tried to avoid unneccessary stops, so I could get to the top faster. 
						The name says for it's self - between two snowy peaks there is a gorgeous lake with a cabin. Me and my crew stayed
						in that cabin overnight a few times, which rewarded us with a great view on the northern lights.</p>

						<h2>The Lawghton Glacier</h2>
						<p class="paragraphs">One of the greatest hiking experiences I've ever had. I spent the whole day walking it, but it was 
						definetely worth it. I went by myself, alost stumbled upon a grizzly and climbed the icy landscape. It might look cold, 
						but actually I burned my face while I was up there because of the sun rays that reflected from icy surface. Trail took me
						along the river, which enters the ocean channel in Skagway. Basically, I've followed the river from its end to its beginning,
						where it starts as a set of little streams coming from melting ice. Such trails is a must, at least once in a lifetime.</p>
