						<h2>What's the place about?</h2>
						<p class="paragraphs">Skagway is a small, former gold rush town, that genuinely looks 
						like decorations from some movie set in Hollywood. It is located in
						the South-Eastern part of Alaska, one hour ride from Whitehorse in Yukon 
						(Canada). During summer season (classical one, without wideworld pandemic)
						1.5 million tourists traffic through this little town from cruiseships.
						Trust me, tourists got plenty of reasons for going that far - Skagway 
						isn't cool just by being an Alaskan town, it also possesses many historical
						sights and artifacts, perculiar and rich wildlife, friendliest community
					    ever, but also provides visitors with countless hiking opportunities to places
						beyond imagination. Being an experienced hiker, I doubtlessly place Skagway in
						one of my top locations.</p>
